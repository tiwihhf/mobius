/* formal text below -------------->
this website was built with mobius in mind. the tools used in making this are: html and css. javascript will be implemented too, but not now 
since i haven't learned it yet.
there are lots of easter eggs that can be found if you scour for them. creator's hint: try hovering over certain elements. who knows, maybe you'll
find an unexpected feature!
